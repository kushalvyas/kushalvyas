I'm a AI researcher and PhD student at Rice University working on scalable machine learning methods for large signals. I recently developed a PyTorch library for implicit neural representations named Alpine

Previously, I was a senior ML researcher at Samsung Research America (SRA), Mountain View, CA where I was part of the wonderful multidisciplinary Think Tank Team. 
Before that, I completed my was pursing my masters at the Robotics Institute at Carngie Mellon University studying Computer Vision (MSCV).

## Research interests:
- Neural Representations
- Large-scale solvers, scalable machine learning
- Representation learning
- Domain Specific Languages(DSL) and compilers

I program in Python, C++, and sometimes typescript.
